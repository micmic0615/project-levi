                                pressing spacebar will trigger dash in your current facing direction

                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        significantly buffed movespeed (200 -> 600)
                        <ul>
                            <li>on-dash/on-attack speedboost nerfed (800 -> 600)</li>
                            <li>total boosted movespeed is now 1200 (from 1000)</li>
                            <li>on-dash/on-attack speedboost is now only given by the 1st attack (of your 4 attack combo) and the 1st dash (of your 3 dash combo)</li>

                    <li>
                        rebalanced left click attack health and poise damages

                            <li>charging needs 4 seconds of not doing anything (except wasd movement) to reach full charge</li>

                            <li>charge scales left click health and poise damages as well as bullet speed and hitbox</li>
                            <li>maximum charge left click will emit a large green explosion that deals poise damage in a big area (potentially stunning everything in that area)</li>
                            <li>maximum charge dash will give a 1.5 second invulnerability shield</li>
                        </ul>

                        added a placeholder shield function in the right click
                        <ul>
                            <li>gives a 1.5 second (2 seconds if fully charged) invulnerability shield</li>
                            <li>triggers the on-kill machine gun function</li>                            
                            <li>requires at least 50% of your poise to use</li>
                            <li>this consumes the entirety of your poise (if you get hit after the shield expires, you will most likely be stunned)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>attacking stunned enemies now deals 25% more damage</li>

                    <li>
                        added a rally mechanic to synergize with the on-hit and grit shield functions
                        <ul>
                            <li>6% limited lifesteal</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
